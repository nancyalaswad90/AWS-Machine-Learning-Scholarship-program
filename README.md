# AWS Machine Learning Scholarship program


## Scholarship Challenge Phase Requirements



The lessons in the AWS Machine Learning Foundations Course have been specially designed to prepare you to take the full Nanodegree program. We recommend you take the time to go through the carefully prepared lessons, as course completion is required to qualify for a Nanodegree program scholarship seat.




> ## You must fulfill both of these requirements to be eligible for the Nanodegree program scholarship:


- You are required to complete all the lessons and go through all the concepts in this program.

- You are required to take an assessment from which top performers will be selected for one of 425 full scholarships for the AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. More details will be provided via email closer to the Challenge phase end.
